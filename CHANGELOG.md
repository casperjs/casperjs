- dubious tests now have dedicated color & styling
- added hint printing when a possible `casperjs` command call is detected

2012-12-14, v1.0.0-RC6
----------------------

I'm still expecting a 1.0 stable for Christmas. Feedback: bring it on.

### Important Changes & Caveats

#### Added experimental support for frames

A minimal convenient API has been added to Casper in order to ease the switch of current page context:

```js
casper.start('tests/site/frames.html', function() {
    this.test.assertTitle('CasperJS frameset');
});

casper.withFrame('frame1', function() {
    this.test.assertTitle('CasperJS frame 1');
});

casper.then(function() {
    this.test.assertTitle('CasperJS frameset');
});
```

#### Reverted to emulated mouse events

Native mouse events didn't play well with (i)frames, because the computed element coordinates of the clicked element were erroneous.

So programmatic mouse events are reintroduced back into this corrective RC until a better solution is found.

### Bugfixes & enhancements

- merged [#269](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/269) - Windows Batch script: fixed unsupported spaces in path and argument splitting

2012-12-10, v1.0.0-RC5
----------------------

I told you there won't be an 1.0.0-RC5? I lied. Expect 1.0 stable for Christmas, probably.

### Important Changes & Caveats

#### Casper.evaluate() signature compatibility with PhantomJS

`Casper.evaluate()` method signature is now compatible with PhantomJS' one, so you can now write:

```js
casper.evaluate(function(a, b) {
    return a === "foo" && b === "bar";
}, "foo", "bar"); // true
```

The old way to pass arguments has been kept backward compatible in order not to break your existing scripts though:

```js
casper.evaluate(function(a, b) {
    return a === "foo" && b === "bar";
}, {a: "foo", b: "bar"}); // true
```

#### Specification of planned tests

In order to check that every planned test has actuall been executed, a new optional `planned` parameter has been added to `Tester.done()`:

```js
casper.test.assert(true);
casper.test.assert(true);
casper.test.assert(true);
casper.test.done(4);
```

Will trigger a failure:

```
fail: 4 tests planned, 3 tests executed.
```

That's especially useful in case a given test script is abruptly interrupted leaving you with no obvious way to know it and an erroneous success status.

The whole [CapserJS test suite](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/tree/master/tests/) has been migrated to use this new feature.

#### Experimental support for popups

PhantomJS 1.7 ships with support for new opened pages â€” aka popups. CasperJS can now wait for a popup to be opened and loaded to react accordingly using the new [`Casper.waitForPopup()`](http://casperjs.org/api.html#casper.waitForPopup) and [`Casper.withPopup()`](http://casperjs.org/api.html#casper.withPopup) methods:

```js
casper.start('http://foo.bar/').then(function() {
    this.test.assertTitle('Main page title');
    this.clickLabel('Open me a popup');
});

// this will wait for the popup to be opened and loaded
casper.waitForPopup(/popup\.html$/, function() {
    this.test.assertEquals(this.popups.length, 1);
});

// this will set the popup DOM as the main active one only for time the
// step closure being executed
casper.withPopup(/popup\.html$/, function() {
    this.test.assertTitle('Popup title');
});

// next step will automatically revert the current page to the initial one
casper.then(function() {
    this.test.assertTitle('Main page title');
});
```

#### `Casper.mouseEvent()` now uses native events for most operations

Native mouse events from PhantomJS bring a far more accurate behavior.

Also, `Casper.mouseEvent()` will now directly trigger an error on failure instead of just logging an `error` event.

### Bugfixes & enhancements

2012-10-23, v1.0.0-RC3
----------------------

### Important Changes & Caveats

- the `injector` module is now deprecated, but kept for backward compatibility purpose.
- **BC BREAK**: fixes [#220](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/220), [#237](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/237) - added a `waitTimeout` options, removed `defaultWaitTimeout` option.
- **BC BREAK** (for the better): fixes [#249](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/249) - default timeout functions don't `die()` anymore in tests
- **BC BREAK** (for the better): merged [#188](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/188) - Easy access to current response object;
  You can now access the current response object as the first parameter of step callbacks:

```javascript
require('casper').create().start('http://www.google.fr/', function(response) {
    require('utils').dump(response);
}).run();
```

That gives:

```
$ casperjs dump-headers.js
{
    "contentType": "text/html; charset=UTF-8",
    "headers": [
        {
            "name": "Date",
            "value": "Thu, 18 Oct 2012 08:17:29 GMT"
        },
        {
            "name": "Expires",
            "value": "-1"
        },
        // ... lots of other headers
    ],
    "id": 1,
    "redirectURL": null,
    "stage": "end",
    "status": 200,
    "statusText": "OK",
    "time": "2012-10-18T08:17:37.068Z",
    "url": "http://www.google.fr/"
}
```

To fetch a particular header by its name:

```javascript
require('casper').create().start('http://www.google.fr/', function(response) {
    this.echo(response.headers.get('Date'));
}).run();
```

That gives:

```javascript
$ casperjs dump-single-header.js
Thu, 18 Oct 2012 08:26:34 GMT
```

The documentation has been [updated accordingly](http://casperjs.org/api.html#casper.then.callbacks).

### Bugfixes & enhancements

- merged [#234](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/234) - New Windows Loader written in Batch. Python is no more a requirement for using CasperJS on Windows. New installation instructions are [available](http://casperjs.org/installation.html#windows).
- a new `onWaitTimeout` option has been added, to allow defining a default behavior when a `waitFor*` function times out.

- fixed [#235](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/235) - updated `Casper.evaluate()` to use phantomjs >= 1.6 native one. As a consequence, **the `injector` module is marked as deprecated**.
- fixed [#250](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/250) - prevent self tests to be run using the standard `casper test` command
- fixed [#254](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/254) - fix up one use of qsa, hit when filling forms with missing elements
- [fixed](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/commit/ef6c1828c7b64e1cf99b98e27600d0b63308cad3) edge case when current document url couldn't be properly decoded

2012-10-01, v1.0.0-RC2
----------------------

### Important Changes & Caveats

- **PhantomJS 1.6 is now the minimal requirement**, PhantomJS 1.7 is supported.
- CasperJS continues to ship with its own implementation of CommonJS' module pattern, due to the way it has to work to offer its own executable. While the implementations are nearly the same, **100% compatibility is not guaranteed**.

2012-05-29, v0.6.9
------------------

- **BC BREAK:** PhantomJS 1.5 is now the minimal PhantomJS version supported.
- fixed [#114](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/114) - ensured client-side utils are injected before any `evaluate()` call
- merged [#89](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/pull/89) - Support for more mouse events (@nrabinowitz)
- [added a new `error` event, better error reporting](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/commit/2e6988ae821b3251e063d11ba28af59b0683852a)
- fixed [#117](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/117) - `fill()` coulnd't `submit()` a form with a submit input named *submit*
- merged [#122](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/pull/122) - allow downloads to be triggered by more than just `GET` requests
- closed [#57](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/57) - added context to emitted test events + complete assertion framework refactor
- fixed loaded resources array is now reset adequately [reference discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=fr?fromgroups#!topic/casperjs/TCkNzrj1IoA)
- fixed incomplete error message logged when passed an erroneous selector (xpath and css)

2012-05-20, v0.6.8
------------------

- added support for [XPath selectors](http://casperjs.org/#selectors)
- added `Tester.assertNotEquals()` ([@juliangruber](https://github.com/juliangruber))
- fixed [#109](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/109) - CLI args containing `=` (equals sign) were not being parsed properly

2012-05-12, v0.6.7
------------------

- fixes [#107](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/107): client utils were possibly not yet being injected and available when calling `Capser.base64encode()` from some events
- merged [PR #96](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/pull/96): make python launcher use `os.execvp()` instead of `subprocess.Popen()` ([@jart](https://github.com/jart)):
  > This patch fixes a bug where casperjs' python launcher process won't pass along kill
  > signals to the phantomjs subprocess. This patch works by using an exec system call
  > which causes the phantomjs subprocess to completely replace the casperjs parent
  > process (while maintaining the same pid). This patch also has the added benefit of
  > saving 10 megs or so of memory because the python process is discarded.

- **BC BREAK:** reverted 8347278 (refs [#34](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/34) and added a new `clear()` method to *close* a page
    You now have to call `casper.clear()` if you want to stop javascript execution within the remote DOM environment.
- **BC BREAK:** removed `fallbackToHref` option handling in `ClientUtils.click()` (refs [#63](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/63))
- `tester.findTestFiles()` now returns results in predictable order
- added `--log-level` and `--direct` options to `casper test` command
- fixed 0.6.4 version number in `bootstrap.js`
- centralized version number to package.json
- ensured compatibility with PhantomJS 1.5

2012-02-09, v0.6.4
------------------

- fixed `casperjs` command wasn't passing phantomjs native option in the correct order, resulting them not being taken into account by phantomjs engine:
  - fixed [#49](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/49) - `casperjs` is not sending `--ssl-ignore-errors`
  - fixed [#50](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/50) - Cookies not being set when passing `--cookies-file` option
- fixed Python3 compatibility of the `casperjs` executable

2012-02-05, v0.6.3
------------------

- fixed [#48](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/48) - XML Output file doesn't have classpath populated with file name
- refs [#46](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/46) - added value details to Tester `fail` event
- new site design, new [domain](http://casperjs.org/), enhanced & updated docs

2012-01-19, v0.6.2
------------------

- fixed [#41](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/41) - injecting casperjs lib crashes `cmd.exe` on Windows 7
- fixed [#42](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/42) - Use file name of test script as 'classname' in JUnit XML report (@mpeltonen)
- fixed [#43](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/43) - Exit status not reported back to caller
- suppressed colorized output syntax for windows; was making output hard to read
- added patchy `fs.isWindows()` method
- added `--xunit=<filename>` cli option to `$ casperjs test` command for saving xunit results, eg.:

      $ casperjs test tests/suites --xunit=build-result.xml


2012-01-16, v0.6.1
------------------

- restablished js-emulated click simulation first, then native QtWebKit
  events as a fallback; some real world testing have surprinsingly proven the former being often
  more efficient than the latter
- fixed casperjs executable could not handle a `PHANTOMJS_EXECUTABLE` containing spaces
- fixed casper could not be used without the executable [as documented](http://casperjs.org/#faq-executable)
- fixed wrong `debug` log level on `ClientUtils.click()` error; set to `error`

Please check the [updated documentation](http://casperjs.org).

2012-01-12, v0.6.0
------------------

- **BC BREAK:** `Casper.click()` now uses native Webkit mouse events instead of previous crazy utopic javascript emulation
- **BC BREAK:** All errors thrown by CasperJS core are of the new `CasperError` type
- **BC BREAK:** removed obsolete `replaceFunctionPlaceholders()`
- *Deprecated*: `Casper.extend()` method has been deprecated; use natural javascript extension mechanisms instead (see samples)
- added `$ casperjs test` command for running split test suites
- `Casper.open()` can now perform HTTP `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` and `HEAD` operations
- commonjs/nodejs-like module exports implementation
- ported nodejs' `events` module to casperjs; lots of events added, plus some value filtering capabilities
- introduced the `mouse` module to handle native Webkit mouse events
- added support for `RegExp` input in `Casper.resourceExists()`
- added printing of source file path for any uncaught exception printed onto the console
- added an emulation of stack trace printing (but PhantomJS will have to upgrade its javascript engine for it to be fully working though)

Please check the [updated documentation](http://casperjs.org).
