------------------

- **BC BREAK:** reverted 8347278 (refs [#34](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/34) and added a new `clear()` method to *close* a page
    You now have to call `casper.clear()` if you want to stop javascript execution within the remote DOM environment.

- centralized version number to package.json

2012-02-09, v0.6.4

  - fixed [#50](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/50) - Cookies not being set when passing `--cookies-file` option
- fixed Python3 compatibility of the `casperjs` executable

2012-02-05, v0.6.3
------------------

2012-01-19, v0.6.2
------------------

- fixed [#41](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/41) - injecting casperjs lib crashes `cmd.exe` on Windows 7
- fixed [#42](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/42) - Use file name of test script as 'classname' in JUnit XML report (@mpeltonen)
- fixed [#43](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/43) - Exit status not reported back to caller
- suppressed colorized output syntax for windows; was making output hard to read
- added patchy `fs.isWindows()` method

      $ casperjs test tests/suites --xunit=build-result.xml


2012-01-16, v0.6.1
------------------

- restablished js-emulated click simulation first, then native QtWebKit
  events as a fallback; some real world testing have surprinsingly proven the former being often
  more efficient than the latter
- fixed casperjs executable could not handle a `PHANTOMJS_EXECUTABLE` containing spaces
- fixed casper could not be used without the executable [as documented](http://casperjs.org/#faq-executable)
- fixed wrong `debug` log level on `ClientUtils.click()` error; set to `error`

Please check the [updated documentation](http://casperjs.org).

2012-01-12, v0.6.0
------------------

- **BC BREAK:** `Casper.click()` now uses native Webkit mouse events instead of previous crazy utopic javascript emulation
- **BC BREAK:** All errors thrown by CasperJS core are of the new `CasperError` type
- **BC BREAK:** removed obsolete `replaceFunctionPlaceholders()`
- *Deprecated*: `Casper.extend()` method has been deprecated; use natural javascript extension mechanisms instead (see samples)
- added `$ casperjs test` command for running split test suites
- `Casper.open()` can now perform HTTP `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` and `HEAD` operations
- commonjs/nodejs-like module exports implementation
- ported nodejs' `events` module to casperjs; lots of events added, plus some value filtering capabilities
- introduced the `mouse` module to handle native Webkit mouse events
- added support for `RegExp` input in `Casper.resourceExists()`
- added printing of source file path for any uncaught exception printed onto the console
- added an emulation of stack trace printing (but PhantomJS will have to upgrade its javascript engine for it to be fully working though)

Please check the [updated documentation](http://casperjs.org).
