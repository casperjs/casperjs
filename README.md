# Casper.js

Casper.js is a navigation & testing utility for [PhantomJS](http://www.phantomjs.org/). It eases the process of defining a full navigation scenario and provides useful high-level functions, methods & syntaxic sugar for doing common tasks such as:

- defining & ordering navigation steps
- filling forms
- clicking links
- capturing screenshots of a page (or an area)
- making assertions on remote DOM
- logging events
- downloading base64 encoded resources, even binary ones
- catching errors and react accordingly
- writing functional test suite, exporting results as JUnit XML (xUnit)
