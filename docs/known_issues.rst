  Quote from `PhantomJS 2.0 Release Note <http://phantomjs.org/release-2.0.html>`_:

    "PhantomJS 2 can not run scripts written in CoffeeScript anymore (see issue `12410 <https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12410>`_). As a workaround, CoffeeScript users can still compile their scripts to JavaScript first before executing it with PhantomJS."
